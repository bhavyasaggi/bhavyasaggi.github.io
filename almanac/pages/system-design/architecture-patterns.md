# Architecture patterns

Architectures are not (or should not) be about frameworks. Architectures should not be supplied by frameworks.
Frameworks are tools to be used, not architectures to be conformed to. If your architecture is based on frameworks, then it cannot be based on your use cases.

Consider web or service-based architecture only, on basis of following factors:

- Latency
- Consistency
- Throughput
- Availability

Commonly used Infrastructure Patterns that should be known, are as follows:

- Layered Architecture Pattern
- Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern
  - Enterprise service bus
- Microservices Architecture Pattern
  - Service Registry/Discovery
- Client-Server Architecture Pattern
- Event-driven Architecture Pattern
- Blackboard Architecture Pattern
- Master-Slave Architecture Pattern
- Circuit Breaker Architecture Pattern
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture Pattern
