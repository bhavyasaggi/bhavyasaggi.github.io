# Design Patterns

- VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router)
- MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel)

# SOLID

## SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

The single responsibility principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing.

## OCP (Open-Closed Principle)

The open-closed principle states that classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

The principle states that child classes or subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes or super classes.

## ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

The interface segregation principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces or methods they do not use.

## DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

The principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
