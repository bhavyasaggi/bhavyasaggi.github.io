# System Design

## Principles

### DRY

### KISS

### MVP

Minimum Viable Product

### SOLID

https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong?slide=2

#### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

The single responsibility principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing.

#### OCP (Open-Closed Principle)

The open-closed principle states that classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

The principle states that child classes or subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes or super classes.

#### ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

The interface segregation principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces or methods they do not use.

#### DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

The principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

## Software Patterns

Commonly used Software Patterns that should be known, are as follows:

- MVC (Model, View, Controller)
- MVP (Model, View, Presenter)
- MVI (Model, View, Intent)
- MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel)
- VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity and Router)
