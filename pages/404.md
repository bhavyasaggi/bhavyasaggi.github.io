This is a digital garden where I collect thoughts, ideas, and knowledge. Built with 11ty and styled with Pico.css for a clean, minimal experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with proper highlighting
- **Mermaid Charts**: Support for diagrams and flowcharts

## Example Code Block

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Example Mermaid Chart

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> B
```

This is my personal knowledge base and digital garden - a place where ideas grow and evolve over time.

## Philosophy

This space serves as:

- **Learning in Public**: Sharing knowledge as I acquire it
- **Knowledge Management**: Organizing thoughts and insights
- **Creative Expression**: Exploring ideas through writing
- **Community Building**: Connecting with like-minded individuals
