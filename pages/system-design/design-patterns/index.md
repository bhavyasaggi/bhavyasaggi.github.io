- **Creational**: provide object creation mechanisms.
  - _Singleton_: Single instance
  - _Factory_: Create objects without specifying exact class
  - _Builder_: Construct complex objects step by step
- **Structural**: assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
  - _Adapter_: Make incompatible interfaces work together
  - _Decorator_: Add behavior without altering structure
  - _Facade_: Simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Behavioral**: allows for communication between objects.
  - _Observer_: Notify multiple objects about state changes
  - _Strategy_: Encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable
  - _Command_: Encapsulate requests as objects
